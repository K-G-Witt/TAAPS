## The Transforming Australia's Ability to Prevent Suicide (TAAPS) Project:
The TAAPS Project is a comprehensive, multi-phase research project funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) designed to understand, evaluate, and improve how health systems respond to persons presenting to emergency departments (EDs) after self-harm. Through the use of linked administrative health data and dynamic systems modelling, this study aims to inform more effective and targeted suicide prevention strategies in Australia and beyond.
