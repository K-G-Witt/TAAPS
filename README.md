## Transforming Australia's Ability to Prevent Suicide (TAAPS) Projec:
The TAAPS Project is a comprehensive, multi-phase research project funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) designed to understand, evaluate, and improve how health systems respond to persons presenting to emergency departments (EDs) after self-harm. Through the use of linked administrative health data and dynamic systems modelling, this study aims to inform more effective and targeted suicide prevention strategies in Australia and beyond.

### Background:
Globally, one person dies by suicide every 40 seconds. Suicide is the leading cause of premature death for Australians aged 18–44 and remains a top cause of mortality in similar age groups worldwide. Suicide and non-fatal self-harm together carry immense human and economic costs. In Australia, suicide costs the economy over $30.5 billion AUD annually, while in the UK, it's estimated at over £9.5 billion. The majority of these costs stem from healthcare, lost productivity, and the emotional toll on families and communities.

Non-fatal self-harm—which includes self-injury or poisoning regardless of intent—is a key risk factor for suicide. For every suicide, many more individuals present to EDs with self-harm, but only a fraction receive follow-up care. Effective interventions exist (e.g., CBT, DBT), yet barriers such as workforce shortages, stigma, and fragmented services limit access and impact.

Despite decades of investment in mental healthcare, the proportion of individuals receiving timely, effective treatment following self-harm has not improved. Addressing this critical gap requires a system-wide understanding of health service pathways—and how these relate to future risk.

### Project Aims:
The TAAPS project aims to:
1. Map the full range of health service contacts individuals have following ED presentations for self-harm;
2. Identify and classify patterns of health care use across mental health, primary care, AOD (alcohol and other drug) services, and pharmacotherapy;
3. Determine how these patterns relate to outcomes, such as self-harm repetition or suicide within a 1-year period;
4. Develop a systems modelling tool to simulate the impact of changes to the mental health and suicide prevention system.

### Data Sources:
The TAAPS Project utilises data linkage to combine information from a wide array of services, including:
1. National Non-Admitted Patient Database – Emergency Care (NNAPD-EC);
2. National Hospital Morbidity Dataset (NHMD);
3. Community Health Minimum Dataset (CHMD);
4. Alcohol and Drug Information System (ADIS) and the Victorian Alcohol and Drug Collection (VADC);
5. Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS);
6. Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS);
7. Victorian Death Index (VDI) and the National Death Index (NDI)

Linkage is conducted via the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) using the National Linkage Map, with clerical review ensuring high-quality matching.
