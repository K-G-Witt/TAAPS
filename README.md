## Transforming Australia's Ability to Prevent Suicide (TAAPS) Project:
The TAAPS Project is a comprehensive, multi-phase research project funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). Using linked administrative health care data from the Centre for Victorian Data Linkage (CVDL) and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), the TAAPS project aims to answer two key research questions:
1. What are the patterns of health services use in the year prior to, during, and following an episode of self-harm resulting in presentation to the emergency department?
2. Using dynamic systems simulation, how could the health care system be transformed to reduce self-harm and suicide rates by half within a decade?

### Background:
Globally, one person dies by suicide every 30 seconds (Meda et al., 2025). Suicide is the leading cause of premature death for Australians aged 18–44 and remains a top cause of mortality in similar age groups worldwide. Suicide is associated with immense human and economic costs. In Australia, suicide costs the economy over $30.5 billion AUD annually, while in the UK, it's estimated at over £9.5 billion. The majority of these costs stem from healthcare, lost productivity, and the emotional toll on families and communities. One in five of us will loose a 

Non-fatal self-harm—which includes self-injury or poisoning regardless of intent—is a key risk factor for suicide. For every suicide, many more individuals present to EDs with self-harm, but only a fraction receive follow-up care. Effective interventions exist (e.g., CBT, DBT), yet barriers such as workforce shortages, stigma, and fragmented services limit access and impact.

Despite decades of investment in mental healthcare, the proportion of individuals receiving timely, effective treatment following self-harm has not improved. Addressing this critical gap requires a system-wide understanding of health service pathways—and how these relate to future risk.

### Project Aims:


### Data Sources:
The TAAPS Project utilises data linkage to combine information from a wide array of services, including:
1. National Non-Admitted Patient Database – Emergency Care (NNAPD-EC);
2. National Hospital Morbidity Dataset (NHMD);
3. Community Health Minimum Dataset (CHMD);
4. Alcohol and Drug Information System (ADIS) and the Victorian Alcohol and Drug Collection (VADC);
5. Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS);
6. Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS);
7. Victorian Death Index (VDI) and the National Death Index (NDI)

Linkage was conducted via the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) using the National Linkage Map, with clerical review to ensure high-quality matching.
